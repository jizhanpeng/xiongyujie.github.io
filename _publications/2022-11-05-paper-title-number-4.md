excerpt: 'This paper presents a vertebral corner detection framework with an embedded Transformer mechanism for calculating Cobb angles. It uses data augmentation, Transformer, and Vector Loss modules to solve automated measurement issues. Experiments on the MICCAI 2019 dataset show the method has high accuracy (SMAPE of 9.01, 1.80 improvement), and can help clinical decision - making. Future work will focus on reducing model depth and complexity.'
