excerpt: 'This paper proposes a vertebral corner detection framework with an embedded Transformer mechanism to calculate the Cobb angle by locating vertebral corners. It uses data augmentation, the Transformer module, and the Vector Loss module to address issues in automated vertebral Cobb angle measurement. Experiments on the MICCAI 2019 Open Spine Challenge dataset show that the method has high accuracy and robustness, with a SMAPE of 9.01, an improvement of 1.80 compared to the latest methods, and can assist in clinical treatment decision - making, while also pointing out the need to reduce the model's depth and complexity in the future.'
