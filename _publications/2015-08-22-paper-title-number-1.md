<div style="text-align: justify;">This paper presents a method for text-independent writer identification using SIFT descriptor and contour­ directional feature (CDF). The proposed method contains two stages. In the first stage, a codebook of local texture patterns is constructed by clustering a set of SIFT descriptors extracted from images. Using this codebook, the occurrence histograms are calculated to determine the similarities between different images. For each image, we obtain a candidate list of reference images. The next stage is to refine the candidate list using the contour­ directional feature and SIFT descriptor. The proposed method is evaluated with two datasets: the ICFHR2012-Latin dataset and the ICDAR2013 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and archives the best performance.</div>
