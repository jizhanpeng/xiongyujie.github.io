<div style="text-align: justify;">The emergence of cloud computing in big data era has exerted a substantial impact on our daily lives. The conventional reliability-aware workflow scheduling (RWS) is capable of improving or maintaining system reliability by fault tolerance techniques such as replication and checkpointing based recovery. However, the fault tolerant techniques used in RWS would inevitably result in higher system energy consumption, longer execution time, and worse thermal profiles that would in turn lead to a decreased hardware lifespan. To mitigate the lifetime-energy-makespan issues of RWS in cloud computing systems for big data, we propose a novel methodology that decomposes the complicated studied problem. In this methodology, we provide three procedures to solve the energy consumption, execution makespan, and hardware lifespan issues in cloud systems executing real-time workflow applications. We implement numerous simulation experiments to validate the proposed methodology for RWS. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed RWS strategies outperform comparative approaches in reducing energy consumption, shortening execution makespan, and prolonging system lifespan while maintaining high reliability. The improvements on energy saving, reduction on makespan, and increase in lifespan can be up to 23.8%, 18.6%, and 69.2%, respectively. Results also show the potentiality of the proposed method to develop a distributed analysis system for big data that serves satellite signal processing, earthquake early warning, and so on.</div>
