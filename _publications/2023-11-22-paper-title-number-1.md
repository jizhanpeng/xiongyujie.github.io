<div style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, multi-view semi-supervised learning has gradually become a popular research direction. The classic binary classification methods in this field are multi-view Laplacian support vector machines (MvLapSVM) and multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines (MvLapTSVM), which extend semisupervised support vector machine to multi-view learning. Nevertheless, similar to the majority of SVM-based multi-view methods, the above methods are two-view methods that cannot fully leverage the information from all views and are constructed based on the ùêø2 norm. Additionally, in semi-supervised graph learning, the quality of the graph often has a significant impact on the results. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-view hypergraph regularized Lp norm least squares twin support vector machines (MvHGLpLSTSVM) that can handle general multi-view data for semi-supervised learning. It extends hypergraph learning to multi-view learning and combines Lp norm to further explore the manifold structure and embedded geometric information of multi-view data. By using equality constraints, we design a simple and effective iterative algorithm. In the classification of six multi-view datasets, we compare the proposed method with some other state-of-the-art methods, and the results show that the proposed method is effective.</div>
