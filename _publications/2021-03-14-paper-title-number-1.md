<div style="text-align: justify;">In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the performance of the text-independent feature and text factors of the handwriting on Chinese writer identification. Text factors contain two types of information: the number of characters in both query and reference and the number of the same characters in both query and reference. We conclude that the performance increases when the query and reference contain more characters, and the minimum number of needed characters is 50. The number of the same characters in both query and reference has little influence on the identification when the number of characters is more than 50. The conclusions are verified by repeated writer identification tests with different amount of characters on the handwriting document pages.</div>
