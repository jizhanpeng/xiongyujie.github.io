excerpt: 'This paper proposes a biomedical event trigger detection method based on a two - stage question - answering paradigm. It uses syntactic - distance - based attention and word - entity - event co - occurrence features to address existing problems in trigger detection. Experiments on the MLEE corpus show that the model outperforms baseline models, with an F1 - score of 81.39%, and the author also plans to explore further improvements in the future.'
