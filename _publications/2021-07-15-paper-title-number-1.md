<div style="text-align: justify;">U-Net shows a remarkable performance and makes significant progress for segmentation task in medical images. Despite the outstanding achievements, the common case of defect detection in industrial scenes is still a challenging task, due to the noisy background, unpredictable environment, varying shapes and sizes of the defects. Traditional U-Net may not be suitable for low-quality images with low illumination and corruption, which are often presented in the practical collections in real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose an attention U-Net with feature fusion module for combining multi-scale features to detect the defects in noisy images automatically. Feature fusion module contains convolution kernels of different scales to capture shallow layer features and combine them with the high-dimensional features. Meanwhile, attention gates are used to enhance the robustness of skip connection between the feature maps. The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets. The best precision rate and MIoU of defect detection are 95.6% and 92.5%. The best F-score of concrete crack detection is 95.0%. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves promising results in both datasets. It demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms other U-Net-based approaches for defect detection in low-quality images. Experimental results have shown the possibility of developing a mixture system that can be deployed in many applications, such as remote sensing image analysis, earthquake disaster situation assessment, and so on.</div>
